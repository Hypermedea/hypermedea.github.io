                <h2>A Framework for Web (of Things) Agents</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Hypermedea is a framework to develop autonomous agents that are capable of navigating the Web.
                Autonomous agents are particulary relevant as controllers on the Web of Things, e.g. in building automation systems or for industrial control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypermedea follows the multi-agent oriented programming (MAOP) approach, which provides several abstraction layers,
                from the embodiment of agents in an environment to their coordination via agent organizations.
                Hypermedea provides utilities to program agents against a particular environment: the Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                In MAOP, an agent perceives and acts on its environment via proxy entities called <em>Artifacts</em>.
                Hypermedea is composed of four artifacts.
                This tutorial introduces them one by one.
            </p>

            <h3>Linked Data Navigation</h3>
            <p>
                The first action that all Web agents perform is Web navigation.
                Hypermedea focuses on Linked Data navigation: crawled resources have an RDF representation.
                The <em>Linked Data artifact</em> exposes an operation to dereference a URI, i.e. a GET operation (<code>get/1</code>), and keeps its RDF representation in a knowledge base.
                The artifact also keeps track of visited resources (<code>visited/1</code>) and pending dereferencing operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following code snippet (in the <a href="http://jason.sourceforge.net/">Jason</a> agent programming language) performs a GET operation on a known URI and prints the number of received RDF triples.
            </p>
            <p>
<pre class="snippet">
+!run <- get("https://territoire.emse.fr/kg/emse/fayol") .

+visited(URI) <- !countTriples .

+!countTriples
  <-
  .count(rdf(S, P, O), Count) ;
  .print("found ", Count, " triples.") .
</pre> 
            </p>
            <p>
                This first program should read as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>once the agent has the intention to run (<code>!run</code>), it calls a GET operation on the <a href="https://territoire.emse.fr/kg/emse/fayol">entry point to the Fayol Knowledge Graph</a>, an RDF dataset describing the building of Institut Fayol at Mines Saint-Ã‰tienne;</li>
                <li>once the agent believes the resource has been visited (<code>visited(URI)</code>), it has the intention of counting triples (<code>!countTriples</code>)</li>
                <li>once the agent has that intention, it executes a sequence of two actions: it first counts the number of RDF triples included in its belief base (<code>rdf(S, P, O)</code>) and then prints that number.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Jason is a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent programming framework. Beliefs are ground predicates that represent the internal state of the agent.
                Desires are goals that the agent has in reaction to particular events (either triggered by perception or by internal actions).
                Intentions are the association of a goal and a plan that the agent believes can be executed and achieves the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Jason program is a collection of rules <code>Event <- Plan</code> that associate events to possible plans.
                Events are the addition or deletion of a belief or a goal.
                For example, <code>+visited(URI)</code> is the addition of a belief (triggered by the Linked Data artifact) while <code>+!countTriples</code> is the addition of a goal (triggered by another plan).
                A plan is always a sequence of actions (separated by <code>;</code>).
                In the above program, <code>.count(...)</code> and <code>.print(...)</code> are internal actions, provided not by an artifact but by the <a href="http://jason.sourceforge.net/doc/api/jason/stdlib/package-summary.html">Jason standard library</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Linked Data artifact processes GET operations asynchronously: an agent can call several GET operations in parallel and wait for <code>+visited(URI)</code> events to be triggered (or pursue other goals).
                As a result, Hypermedea agents can efficiently crawl a given Knowledge Graph, i.e. to discover their environment and the possible actions their environment affords.
                The following program crawls any Knowledge Graph given its entry point and known vocabularies (see initial intention <code>!crawl(URI)</code>).
            </p>
<pre class="snippet">knownVocab("http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/") .
knownVocab("http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/") .
knownVocab("https://w3id.org/bot#") .
knownVocab("https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/td#") .
knownVocab("https://example.org/ontology#") .

+rdf(S, P, Target)[crawler_source(Anchor)] : crawling
  <-
  if (knownVocab(Vocab) & .substring(Vocab, P, 0)) {
    + barrier_resource(Anchor, Target)
  } .

+!crawl(URI)
  <-
  +crawling ;
  visit(URI) ;
  for (hasPart(vocabularySpace, Vocab)) {
    visit(Vocab)
  } .

// event generated by the LinkedDataArtifact
+visited(URI) : crawling
  <-
  for (barrier_resource(Anchor, URI)) {
    if (not visited(URI) | toVisit(URI)) {
      visit(URI)
    }
  } ;
  if (crawler_status(false)) {
    -crawling
  } .
</pre>
            <p>
                In the above program, all discovered RDF triples are considered as hyperlinks pointing to other Web resources.
                For a given triple, the agent navigates from the anchor resource to the target resource (object) only if the predicate URI matches the namespace of some known vocabulary.
                This program may not terminate; other Jason rules could be added, e.g. to restrict link traversal to a finite number of hops.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jason is a Turing-complete programming language. Agents may execute any navigation program.
                Yet, the event-based execution model of Jason has proven efficient compared to dedicated Linked Data crawlers such as <a href="https://linked-data-fu.github.io/">Linked-Data-Fu</a>.
                The above program is as efficient as Linked-Data-Fu to crawl the Fayol Knowledge Graph (7,380 RDF triples contained in 290 interlinked resources).
